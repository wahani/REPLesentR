Description: It is fun and also nerdy to do presentations directly in
  the REPL. You can do your presentation in the console but write your slides in RMarkdown or any other text format. For this we provide a modular system to generate slide decks for display in the R REPL or console. This project is inspired by the REPLesent tool for presentation in the Scala REPL.
