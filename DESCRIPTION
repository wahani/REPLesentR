Description: A set of tools to do presentations inside the REPL. Presentations
    can be written in RMarkdown or any other text format. A set of convenient
    navigation options as well as code evaluation during a presentation is
    provided. It is great for tech talks with live coding examples and
    tutorials. While this is not a replacement for standard presentation
    formats, it's old-school looks might just be what sets it apart. This
    project has been inspired by the REPLesent project for presentations in the
    Scala REPL.
