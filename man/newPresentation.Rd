\description{
Creates a new instance of a presentation. Currently it has only one method:
\code{start} which is called without any arguments. It starts a presentation
or resumes where you left off. A presentation runs inside your R console and
the idea is to maximize the window on your screen for a presentation mode.

\details{
You can completely reconfigure or redefine parts of this package.
  All components are modules and can be extended or replaced. This is just a
  default configuration for a \link{Presentation}.

To convert from Rmd to md formats \code{knitr::knit} is used. To convert from
  md to plain \code{knitr::pandoc(file, format = "plain")} is used. If you
  want to configure the process of this conversion please see the
  documentation of these two functions.

For navigation inside the presentation mode, please see the examples below.
  Or start a presentation and type 'h' for help.

## Start with the example:
